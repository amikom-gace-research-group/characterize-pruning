* Pruning Experimentation 
This repo is an archive for experiments exploring model pruning. One of the common ways of compressing AI models. 

** Train
First, it is required to train the base model. Currently, the choice are =swin_v2_s= or =swin_v2_b=. Currently training is also restricted to =Flowers102= dataset. Other configurable options include: epochs, batch size, save path, and save setup (state dict, or full). Python script is executed as follows:

#+begin_src bash
python3 train.py --dataset Flowers102 --model swin_v2_s --epochs 8 --batch-size 8 --save-as full --save-path ./models/swin_v2_s-Flowers102-1.pth
#+end_src

Bash script (available as train.sh) is available for automation, the above configurable option is editable inside, one example to execute the bash script in the background:

#+begin_src bash
chmod +x ./train.sh
nohup ./train.sh &
#+end_src
